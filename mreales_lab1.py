# Colab Yahoo Introduction to the Research Environment

The research environment is powered by IPython notebooks, which allow one to perform a great deal of data analysis and statistical validation. We'll demonstrate a few simple techniques here.

##Code Cells vs. Text Cells

As you can see, each cell can be either code or text. To select between them, choose from the 'Cell Type' dropdown menu on the top left.

##Executing a Command

A code cell will be evaluated when you press play, or when you press the shortcut, shift-enter. Evaluating a cell evaluates each line of code in sequence, and prints the results of the last line below the cell.

**My own example 1**
"""

2.345 + 2.345

"""Sometimes there is no result to be printed, as is the case with assignment.

**My own example 2**
"""

variable_x_ejemplo = 145.5

"""Remember that only the result from the last line is printed.

**My own example 3**
"""

2045 + 5343
34 - 70012
(35 - 46)*5 + 1000
45 * 80
(340 + 200 ) * (10 * 23) - 56

"""However, you can print whichever lines you want using the `print` statement.

**My own example 4**
"""

print(1500 + 503 )
print('Miguel Angel Reales')
2045 - 2026
print('Bienvenido a mi trabajo')
print('la nota de esto será, por favor ')
((5 * 4)+( 30* 1))/10

"""##Knowing When a Cell is Running

While a cell is running, a `[*]` will display on the left. When a cell has yet to be executed, `[ ]` will display. When it has been run, a number will display indicating the order in which it was run during the execution of the notebook `[5]`. Try on this cell and note it happening.

**My own example 5**
"""

#Take some time to run something
caja = 100000
for precio in range(1,20,2):
  acumulado_precio = caja + precio
  caja = acumulado_precio
caja

"""##Importing Libraries

The vast majority of the time, you'll want to use functions from pre-built libraries. You can't import every library on Quantopian due to security issues, but you can import most of the common scientific ones. Here I import numpy and pandas, the two most common and useful libraries in quant finance. I recommend copying this import statement to every new notebook.

Notice that you can rename libraries to whatever you want after importing. The `as` statement allows this. Here we use `np` and `pd` as aliases for `numpy` and `pandas`. This is a very common aliasing and will be found in most code snippets around the web. The point behind this is to allow you to type fewer characters when you are frequently accessing these libraries.

**My own example 6**
"""

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
serie_numeros = pd.Series(['Primero', 'Segundos', 'terceros', 'cuartos', 'quintos'], dtype='string')
print(serie_numeros)
arreglo = np.array([1.1, 9, 3, 4.5])
print(arreglo)
# This is a plotting library for pretty pictures.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, grafica = plt.subplots()
grafica.scatter([1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4], [1, 2, 0.1, 1.4, 2, 0.25, 1])
plt.show()

"""##Tab Autocomplete

Pressing tab will give you a list of IPython's best guesses for what you might want to type next. This is incredibly valuable and will save you a lot of time. If there is only one possible option for what you could type next, IPython will fill that in for you. Try pressing tab very frequently, it will seldom fill in anything you don't want, as if there is ambiguity a list will be shown. This is a great way to see what functions are available in a library.

Try placing your cursor after the `.` and pressing tab.

**My own example 7**
"""

import math
x=3.56
math.modf(x)

"""##Getting Documentation Help

Placing a question mark after a function and executing that line of code will give you the documentation IPython has for that function. It's often best to do this in a new cell, as you avoid re-executing other code and running into bugs.

**My own example 8**
"""

import numpy as np
salida = np.random.random(size = 5)
print ("la salida será un arreglo flotante", salida)

"""##Sampling

We'll sample some random data using a function from `numpy`.

**My example 9**
"""

import numpy as np
X = np.random.normal(100, 0.5, 50)
print("imprime un arrego de x elementos")
X

"""##Plotting

We can use the plotting library we imported as follows.

**My own example 10**
"""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig,grafica = plt.subplots()
grafica.barh([1, 2, 3], [0.4, -2.9, 5.9])
plt.show()

"""###Squelching Line Output

You might have noticed the annoying line of the form `[<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f72fdbc1710>]` before the plots. This is because the `.plot` function actually produces output. Sometimes we wish not to display output, we can accomplish this with the semi-colon as follows.

**My own example 11**
"""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x=plt.plot([2,5,7,1])
plt.show(x);
y=plt.plot([1,3,3,5])
plt.show(y)

"""###Adding Axis Labels

No self-respecting quant leaves a graph without labeled axes. Here are some commands to help with that.

**My own example 12**
"""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
X = np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)
X2 = np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)
plt.plot(X);
plt.plot(X2);
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Returns')
plt.legend(['X', 'X2']);

"""##Generating Statistics

Let's use `numpy` to take some simple statistics.

**My own example 13**
"""

import numpy as np #arreglode numero aleatorio
a = np.array([[10, 24], [45, 60]])
z=np.std(a)
z

"""##Getting Real Pricing Data

Randomly sampled data can be great for testing ideas, but let's get some real data. We can use `get_pricing` to do that. You can use the `?` syntax as discussed above to get more information on `get_pricing`'s arguments.
"""

!pip install yfinance

"""**My own example 14**"""

import yfinance as yf

apple= yf.Ticker("aapl")

# show actions (dividends, splits)
apple.actions

# show dividends
apple.dividends

# show splits
apple.splits

"""Our data is now a dataframe. You can see the datetime index and the colums with different pricing data.

**My own example 15**
"""

# IMPORT THE LIBRARY
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# CREATE TICKER INSTANCE FOR AMAZON
amzn = yf.Ticker("AMZN")

# GET TODAYS DATE AND CONVERT IT TO A STRING WITH YYYY-MM-DD FORMAT (YFINANCE EXPECTS THAT FORMAT)
end_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
amzn_hist = amzn.history(start='2022-01-01',end=end_date)
print(amzn_hist)

"""This is a pandas dataframe, so we can index in to just get price like this. For 

1.   Elemento de la lista
2.   Elemento de la lista

more info on pandas, please [click here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html).

Because there is now also date information in our data, we provide two series to `.plot`. `X.index` gives us the datetime index, and `X.values` gives us the pricing values. These are used as the X and Y coordinates to make a graph.

**My own example 16**
"""

plt.plot(X.index, X.values,'bo')
plt.xlabel('años')
plt.ylabel('precio')
plt.legend(['leyenda']);

"""We can get statistics again on real data.

Variable_salida[1, :] = 1.0
Variable_salida[0, :] = 0.1
np.mean(Variable_salida)
np.std(Variable_salida)

"""##Getting Returns from Prices

We can use the `pct_change` function to get returns. Notice how we drop the first element after doing this, as it will be `NaN` (nothing -> something results in a NaN percent change).

**My own example 18**
"""

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
s = pd.Series([80, 81, 75])
s.pct_change(periods=2)

"""We can plot the returns distribution as a histogram.

"""Now let's go backwards and generate data out of a normal distribution using the statistics we estimated from Microsoft's returns. We'll see that we have good reason to suspect Microsoft's returns may not be normal, as the resulting normal distribution looks far different.

##Generating a Moving Average

`pandas` has some nice tools to allow us to generate rolling statistics. Here's an example. Notice how there's no moving average for the first 60 days, as we don't have 60 days of data on which to generate the statistic.

**My own example 22**

# Introduction to Python
by Maxwell Margenot

Part of the Quantopian Lecture Series:

* [www.quantopian.com/lectures](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures)
* [github.com/quantopian/research_public](https://github.com/quantopian/research_public)


---

All of the coding that you will do on the Quantopian platform will be in Python. It is also just a good, jack-of-all-trades language to know! Here we will provide you with the basics so that you can feel confident going through our other lectures and understanding what is happening.

## Code Comments

A comment is a note made by a programmer in the source code of a program. Its purpose is to clarify the source code and make it easier for people to follow along with what is happening. Anything in a comment is generally ignored when the code is actually run, making comments useful for including explanations and reasoning as well as removing specific lines of code that you may be unsure about. Comments in Python are created by using the pound symbol (`# Insert Text Here`). Including a `#` in a line of code will comment out anything that follows it.

**My own example 23**
"""

# estas lineas no salen en la salida de codigo
# se puede escribir lo que sea
# no afectara nada de lo colocado en el codigo
# a b c d e f g  h j k u 
# x=4.5
# 4-7
""" lo que aparece entre comillas saldra a forma de texto  """
" y forma de información visible"
" nada de esto afecta el codigo"
"al igual que una operación matematica solo sale el ultimo string"

"""You may hear text enclosed in triple quotes (`''' Insert Text Here '''`) referred to as multi-line comments, but this is not entirely accurate. This is a special type of `string` (a data type we will cover), called a `docstring`, used to explain the purpose of a function.

Make sure you read the comments within each code cell (if they are there). They will provide more real-time explanations of what is going on as you look at each line of code.

## Variables

Variables provide names for values in programming. If you want to save a value for later or repeated use, you give the value a name, storing the contents in a variable. Variables in programming work in a fundamentally similar way to variables in algebra, but in Python they can take on various different data types.

The basic variable types that we will cover in this section are `integers`, `floating point numbers`, `booleans`, and `strings`. 

An `integer` in programming is the same as in mathematics, a round number with no values after the decimal point. We use the built-in `print` function here to display the values of our variables as well as their types!

**My own example 24**
"""

my_integer = 1050
num_float = -30.8999
float_test = 1.1 + 2.2
print(float_test, type(float_test))
print(num_float, type (num_float))
print(my_integer, type(my_integer))
my_float = 4.67
print(my_float,'es de tipo:',type(my_float))
my_float = float(5)
print(my_float,'vuelve a 5 como numero flotante',type(my_float))

"""Variables, regardless of type, are assigned by using a single equals sign (`=`). Variables are case-sensitive so any changes in variation in the capitals of a variable name will reference a different variable entirely."""

one = 1
print(one)
'error corregido'

"""A `floating point` number, or a `float` is a fancy name for a real number (again as in mathematics). To define a `float`, we need to either include a decimal point or specify that the value is a float.

A variable of type `float` will not round the number that you store in it, while a variable of type `integer` will. This makes `floats` more suitable for mathematical calculations where you want more than just integers.

Note that as we used the `float()` function to force an number to be considered a `float`, we can use the `int()` function to force a number to be considered an `int`.

**My own example 25**
"""

#aqui se vuelve un elemento 
my_float=float(-300)
my_int = int(20.5)
txt_2 = str(45)
print (txt_2, type(txt_2))
print(my_int, type(my_int))
print(my_float, type(my_float))
my_string = 'texto entre comillas simples'
print(my_string)
my_string = "texto entre comillas dobles"
print(my_string)
two_string='nombramientos'
three="informacion"

"""The `int()` function will also truncate any digits that a number may have after the decimal point!

Strings allow you to include text as a variable to operate on. They are defined using either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

Both are allowed so that we can include apostrophes or quotation marks in a string if we so choose.

Booleans, or `bools` are binary variable types. A `bool` can only take on one of two values, these being `True` or `False`. There is much more to this idea of truth values when it comes to programming, which we cover later in the [Logical Operators](#id-section5) of this notebook.

**My own example 26**
"""

my_bool = True
my_boolean = False 
print(my_bool, type(my_bool))
print(my_boolean, type(my_boolean))
print(1 > 0)  
print(1 <= 0) 
print(9 == 9)

"""There are many more data types that you can assign as variables in Python, but these are the basic ones! We will cover a few more later as we move through this tutorial.

## Basic Math

Python has a number of built-in math functions. These can be extended even further by importing the **math** package or by including any number of other calculation-based packages.

All of the basic arithmetic operations are supported: `+`, `-`, `/`, and `*`. You can create exponents by using `**` and modular arithmetic is introduced with the mod operator, `%`.

**My own example 27**
"""

print('Addition => suma ', 20.45 + 200, 45+101 )
print('Subtraction => resta', 70-4045,34-1.2355)
print('Multiplication => producto ', 2*5,67*50)
print('Division => cociente', 15/2, 45/7)
print('Exponentiation => elevado', 4**3**2)
print('Modulo: ', 15 % 4)
x_variable= 35%3
print(x_variable)

"""If you are not familiar with the the mod operator, it operates like a remainder function. If we type $15 \ \% \ 4$, it will return the remainder after dividing $15$ by $4$.

Mathematical functions also work on variables!
"""

x = 40.56
y = 3.56
w = 5
z = 0.3
print((x*y)+(w-z))
print((x*y*w-z))

"""Make sure that your variables are floats if you want to have decimal points in your answer. If you perform math exclusively with integers, you get an integer. Including any float in the calculation will make the result a float."""

x = 40.56
y = 3.56
w = 5
z = 0.3
print(w/z)
print(y/w)

"""Python has a few built-in math functions. The most notable of these are:

* `abs()`
* `round()`
* `max()`
* `min()`
* `sum()`

These functions all act as you would expect, given their names. Calling `abs()` on a number will return its absolute value. The `round()` function will round a number to a specified number of the decimal points (the default is $0$). Calling `max()` or `min()` on a collection of numbers will return, respectively, the maximum or minimum value in the collection. Calling `sum()` on a collection of numbers will add them all up. If you're not familiar with how collections of values in Python work, don't worry! We will cover collections in-depth in the next section. 

Additional math functionality can be added in with the `math` package.
"""

import math

"""The math library adds a long list of new mathematical functions to Python. Feel free to check out the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html) for the full list and details. It concludes some mathematical constants

### Lists

A `list` in Python is an ordered collection of objects that can contain any data type. We define a `list` using brackets (`[]`).

Some data types, like `strings`, are immutable, meaning you cannot change them at all. Once a `string` or other immutable data type has been created, it cannot be directly modified without creating an entirely new object.

**My own example 31**
"""

my_string = ["Strings never change"]
my_string[0] = "z"

"""

extremo = 50

"""### Tuples

A `tuple` is a data type similar to a list in that it can hold different kinds of data types. The key difference here is that a `tuple` is immutable. We define a `tuple` by separating the elements we want to include by commas. It is conventional to surround a `tuple` with parentheses.

"""Unpacking assigns each value of the tuple in order to each variable on the left hand side of the equals sign. Some functions, including user-defined functions, may return tuples, so we can use this to directly unpack them and access the values that we want.

### Sets

A `set` is a collection of unordered, unique elements. It works almost exactly as you would expect a normal set of things in mathematics to work and is defined using braces (`{}`).

**my own example 34**
"""

materias = {'fluidos', 4.5, 'materiales', 4.7,'dinamica', 'se vale soñar'}

"""Calling `len()` on a set will tell you how many elements are in it."""

print(len(materias))

'cats' in materias # Here we check for membership using the `in` keyword.

"""Here we checked to see whether the string 'cats' was contained within our `animal_set` and it returned `True`, telling us that it is indeed in our set.

We can connect sets by using typical mathematical set operators, namely `|`, for union, and `&`, for intersection. Using `|` or `&` will return exactly what you would expect if you are familiar with sets in mathematics.
"""

print(materias | pasadas) # You can also write things_i_like | animal_set with no difference

"""Pairing two sets together with `|` combines the sets, removing any repetitions to make every set element unique."""

print(materias & pasadas) # You can also write things_i_like & animal_set with no difference

"""Pairing two sets together with `&` will calculate the intersection of both sets, returning a set that only contains what they have in common.

If you are interested in learning more about the built-in functions for sets, feel free to check out the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html).

### Dictionaries

Another essential data structure in Python is the dictionary. Dictionaries are defined with a combination of curly braces (`{}`) and colons (`:`). The braces define the beginning and end of a dictionary and the colons indicate key-value pairs. A dictionary is essentially a set of key-value pairs. The key of any entry must be an immutable data type. This makes both strings and tuples candidates. Keys can be both added and deleted.

In the following example, we have a dictionary composed of key-value pairs where the key is a genre of fiction (`string`) and the value is a list of books (`list`) within that genre. Since a collection is still considered a single entity, we can use one to collect multiple variables or values into one key-value pair.

## Logical Operators
### Basic Logic

Logical operators deal with `boolean` values, as we briefly covered before. If you recall, a `bool` takes on one of two values, `True` or `False` (or $1$ or $0$). The basic logical statements that we can make are defined using the built-in comparators. These are `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to).

**My own example 40**
"""

print(1 + 1 == 2)
print("Walter" + "White" == "WalterWhite")
print(['Miguel', 'Sara'] + ['Jose'] == ['Sara', 'Jose', 'Miguel'])

a = [1,2,3,4,5]#Esta 3 en la lista a?
print(3 in a) #No está 12 en la lista a?
print(12 not in a) 
str = "Hello World" #Contiene World el string str?
print("World" in str) #Contiene world el string str? (nota: distingue mayúsculas y minúsculas)
print("world" in str)  
print("code" not in str)

"""These comparators also work in conjunction with variables."""

import math
n = 3.14
print(math.pi <= n)
print(math.pi == math.pi)

"""We can string these comparators together to make more complex logical statements using the logical operators `or`, `and`, and `not`. """

import math
test1 = math.e == 2.4
test_2 = math.pi <= 3.1416
print("Statement 1 truth value: {0}".format(test1))
print("Statement 2 truth value: {0}".format(test_2))
print("Statement 1 and Statement 2: {0}".format(test1 and test_2))

"""The `or` operator performs a logical `or` calculation. This is an inclusive `or`, so if either component paired together by `or` is `True`, the whole statement will be `True`. The `and` statement only outputs `True` if all components that are `and`ed together are True. Otherwise it will output `False`. The `not` statement simply inverts the truth value of whichever statement follows it. So a `True` statement will be evaluated as `False` when a `not` is placed in front of it. Similarly, a `False` statement will become `True` when a `not` is in front of it.

Say that we have two logical statements, or assertions, $P$ and $Q$. The truth table for the basic logical operators is as follows:

|  P  |  Q  | `not` P| P `and` Q | P `or` Q|
|:-----:|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `True` | `True` | `False` | `True` | `True` |
| `False` | `True` | `True` | `False` | `True` |
| `True` | `False` | `False` | `False` | `True` |
| `False` | `False` | `True` | `False` | `False` |

We can string multiple logical statements together using the logical operators.
"""

"""Logical statements can be as simple or complex as we like, depending on what we need to express. Evaluating the above logical statement step by step we see that we are evaluating (`True and True`) `or` (`False and not False`). This becomes `True or (False and True`), subsequently becoming `True or False`, ultimately being evaluated as `True`.

#### Truthiness

Data types in Python have a fun characteristic called truthiness. What this means is that most built-in types will evaluate as either `True` or `False` when a boolean value is needed (such as with an if-statement). As a general rule, containers like strings, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and sets, will return `True` if they contain anything at all and `False` if they contain nothing.

"""And so on, for the other collections and containers. `None` also evaluates as `False`. The number `1` is equivalent to `True` and the number `0` is equivalent to `False` as well, in a boolean context.

### If-statements

We can create segments of code that only execute if a set of conditions is met. We use if-statements in conjunction with logical statements in order to create branches in our code. 

An `if` block gets entered when the condition is considered to be `True`. If condition is evaluated as `False`, the `if` block will simply be skipped unless there is an `else` block to accompany it. Conditions are made using either logical operators or by using the truthiness of values in Python. An if-statement is defined with a colon and a block of indented text.

**My example 42**
"""

number = 10
# check if number is greater than 0

Using `>` or `<` or any of the other comparators is not quite so intuitive, however, so we will stay from using comparators with strings in this lecture. Comparators will examine the [lexicographical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order) of the strings, which might be a bit more in-depth than you might like.

Some built-in functions return a boolean value, so they can be used as conditions in an if-statement. User-defined functions can also be constructed so that they return a boolean value. This will be covered later with function definition!

The `in` keyword is generally used to check membership of a value within another value. We can check memebership in the context of an if-statement and use it to output a truth value.

## Loop Structures

Loop structures are one of the most important parts of programming. The `for` loop and the `while` loop provide a way to repeatedly run a block of code repeatedly. A `while` loop will iterate until a certain condition has been met. If at any point after an iteration that condition is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. A `for` loop will iterate over a sequence of values and terminate when the sequence has ended. You can instead include conditions within the `for` loop to decide whether it should terminate early or you could simply let it run its course.

**My own example 43**
"""

letters = iter(word)

In this case, we use the shorthand `i -= 1` (short for `i = i - 1`) so that the value of `i` gets smaller with each iteration. Eventually `i` will be reduced to `0`, rendering the condition `False` and exiting the loop.

A `for` loop iterates a set number of times, determined when you state the entry into the loop. In this case we are iterating over the list returned from `range()`. The `for` loop selects a value from the list, in order, and temporarily assigns the value of `i` to it so that operations can be performed with the value.

pandas is a Python library that provides a collection of powerful data structures to better help you manage data. In this lecture, we will cover how to use the `Series` and `DataFrame` objects to handle data. These objects have a strong integration with NumPy, covered elsewhere in the [lecture series](http://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Introduction-to-NumPy), allowing us to easily do the necessary statistical and mathematical calculations that we need for finance.

## pandas Data Structures

### `Series`

A pandas `Series` is a 1-dimensional array with labels that can contain any data type. We primarily use them for handling time series data. Creating a `Series` is as easy as calling `pandas.Series()` on a Python list or NumPy array.
"""

s = pd.Series([1, 2,'nan', 4, 5])
print(s)
print('error corregido')

"""Every `Series` has a name. We can give the series a name as a parameter or we can define it afterwards by directly accessing the name attribute. In this case, we have given our time series no name so the attribute should be empty.

**My own example 46**
"""

s = pd.Series(['Matemáticas', 'Historia', 'Economía', 'Programación', 'Inglés'], dtype='string')
print(s)
print(s.name)

"""This name can be directly modified with no repercussions."""

s.name = "materias sencillas"
print(s.name)

"""We call the collected axis labels of a `Series` its index. An index can either passed to a `Series` as a parameter or added later, similarly to its name. In the absence of an index, a `Series` will simply contain an index composed of integers, starting at $0$, as in the case of our "Toy Series"."""

print(s.index)

"""pandas has a built-in function specifically for creating date indices, `date_range()`. We use the function here to create a new index for `s`."""

new_index = pd.date_range(start='1/1/2018', periods=5)
print(new_index)

"""An index must be exactly the same length as the `Series` itself. Each index must match one-to-one with each element of the `Series`. Once this is satisfied, we can directly modify the `Series` index, as with the name, to use our new and more informative index (relatively speaking)."""

s.index=new_index
print(s.index)

"""The index of the `Series` is crucial for handling time series, which we will get into a little later.

#### Accessing `Series` Elements

`Series` are typically accessed using the `iloc[]` and `loc[]` methods. We use `iloc[]` to access elements by integer index and we use `loc[]` to access the index of the Series.

**My own example 47**
"""

print("First element of the series: ", s.iloc[4])
print("Last element of the series: ", s.iloc[len(s)-2])

"""We can slice a `Series` similarly to our favorite collections, Python lists and NumPy arrays. We use the colon operator to indicate the slice."""

s.iloc[:4]

"""When creating a slice, we have the options of specifying a beginning, an end, and a step. The slice will begin at the start index, and take steps of size `step` until it passes the end index, not including the end."""

start = 0
end = len(s) - 1
step = 1

s.iloc[start:end:step]

"""We can even reverse a `Series` by specifying a negative step size. Similarly, we can index the start and end with a negative integer value."""

s.iloc[::-1]

"""This returns a slice of the series that starts from the second to last element and ends at the third to last element (because the fourth to last is not included, taking steps of size $1$)."""

s.iloc[-2:-4:-1]

"""We can also access a series by using the values of its index. Since we indexed `s` with a collection of dates (`Timestamp` objects) we can look at the value contained in `s` for a particular date."""

s.loc['2016-01-02':'2016-01-04']

"""With `Series`, we *can* just use the brackets (`[]`) to access elements, but this is not best practice. The brackets are ambiguous because they can be used to access `Series` (and `DataFrames`) using both index and integer values and the results will change based on context (especially with `DataFrames`).

#### Boolean Indexing

In addition to the above-mentioned access methods, you can filter `Series` using boolean arrays. `Series` are compatible with your standard comparators. Once compared with whatever condition you like, you get back yet another `Series`, this time filled with boolean values.

**My own example 48**
"""

d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
ser = pd.Series(data=d, index=['a', 'b', 'c'])

print(ser < 3)

"""We can pass *this* `Series` back into the original `Series` to filter out only the elements for which our condition is `True`."""

print(ser.loc[ser < 3])

"""If we so desire, we can group multiple conditions together using the logical operators `&`, `|`, and `~` (and, or, and not, respectively)."""

print(ser.loc[(ser < 3) & (ser > 1)])

"""This is very convenient for getting only elements of a `Series` that fulfill specific criteria that we need. It gets even more convenient when we are handling `DataFrames`.

### `DataFrames`

Many of the aspects of working with `Series` carry over into `DataFrames`. pandas `DataFrames` allow us to easily manage our data with their intuitive structure. 

Like `Series`, `DataFrames` can hold multiple types of data, but `DataFrames` are 2-dimensional objects, unlike `Series`. Each `DataFrame` has an index and a columns attribute, which we will cover more in-depth when we start actually playing with an object. The index attribute is like the index of a `Series`, though indices in pandas have some extra features that we will unfortunately not be able to cover here. If you are interested in this, check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/advanced.html) on advanced indexing. The columns attribute is what provides the second dimension of our `DataFrames`, allowing us to combine named columns (all `Series`), into a cohesive object with the index lined-up.

We can create a `DataFrame` by calling `pandas.DataFrame()` on a dictionary or NumPy `ndarray`. We can also concatenate a group of pandas `Series` into a `DataFrame` using `pandas.concat()`.

**My own example 49**
"""

import numpy as np

datos_iniciales = {
    'a' : [30,23,56,67,67,89,100],
    'b' : ['L', 'K', 'J', 'M', 'Z','A','E'],
    'c' : np.random.normal(0, 1, 7)
}
print(datos_iniciales)

"""Each `DataFrame` has a few key attributes that we need to keep in mind. The first of these is the index attribute. We can easily include an index of `Timestamp` objects like we did with `Series`."""

frame_data = pd.DataFrame(datos_iniciales, index=pd.date_range('2016-01-01', periods=7))
print(frame_data)

"""As mentioned above, we can combine `Series` into `DataFrames`. Concatatenating `Series` like this will match elements up based on their corresponding index. As the following `Series` do not have an index assigned, they each default to an integer index.

**My own example 50**
"""

import pandas as pd
serie1 = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 1], name='Binario')
serie2 = pd.Series([2, 4, 6, 8, 10], name="pares")
numerosaleatorios = pd.concat([serie1, serie2], axis=1)
print(numerosaleatorios)

"""We will use `pandas.concat()` again later to combine multiple `DataFrame`s into one.

Each `DataFrame` also has a `columns` attribute. These can either be assigned when we call `pandas.DataFrame` or they can be modified directly like the index. Note that when we concatenated the two `Series` above, the column names were the names of those `Series`.
"""

print(numerosaleatorios.columns)

"""To modify the columns after object creation, we need only do the following:"""

numerosaleatorios.columns = ['Shmevens', 'Shmodds']
print(numerosaleatorios)

"""In the same vein, the index of a `DataFrame` can be changed after the fact."""

print(numerosaleatorios.index)

numerosaleatorios.index = pd.date_range("2016-01-01", periods=len(numerosaleatorios))
print(numerosaleatorios)

"""Separate from the columns and index of a `DataFrame`, we can also directly access the values they contain by looking at the values attribute."""

numerosaleatorios.values

"""This returns a NumPy array.

# Next Steps

Managing data gets a lot easier when you deal with pandas, though this has been a very general introduction. There are many more tools within the package which you may discover while trying to get your data to do precisely what you want. If you would rather read more on the additional capabilities of pandas, check out the [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).

#Data Types and Data Structures

# Introduction

This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the Python programming language. If you are new to Python, you should run the code snippets while reading this tutorial. If you are an advanced Python user, please feel free to skip this chapter.

# Basic Variable Types
The basic types of variables in Python are: strings, integers, floating point numbers and booleans.

Strings in python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").

**My own example 51**
"""

primeraparte = 'de tal palo'
segundaparte = "tal astilla"
print(primeraparte + ' ' + segundaparte)

"""An integer is a round number with no values after the decimal point."""

entero=10
print(entero)

"""The built-in function int() can convert a string into an integer."""

text = "puede ser cualquiero tipo de texto !$%&/()) 1234"
print(type(text))
text1="23456789"
numero = int(text1)
print(type(numero))
print(numero)

"""A floating point number, or a float, is a real number in mathematics. In Python we need to include a value after a decimal point to define it as a float"""

puntoflotante = float(text1)
print(type(puntoflotante))

"""As you can see above, if we don't include a decimal value, the variable would be defined as an integer. The built-in function float() can convert a string or an integer into a float."""

variablebooleana = False
variablebooleana2 = True 
print(variablebooleana)
print(variablebooleana2)
print(type(variablebooleana))
print(type(variablebooleana2))

"""A boolean, or bool, is a binary variable. Its value can only be True or False. It is useful when we do some logic operations, which would be covered in our next chapter."""

print("Addition and Subtraction", (125+1.24546)+(5.13-234))
print("saldra un error de aposta probando la division del zero")
print("Multiplication and division ", (2*3)/0)
print("Multiplication and division ", 10/2)
print('exponent', 2**3)

"""**My own example 52**"""

print("mi nombre es Miguel Reales")
print("tengo 19 años")
print("los cumplo a finales de julio")
miedad= 20
mimes=7
añoactual=2022
print("naci hace:",añoactual-2003,"años con:",(12-mimes)+2,"meses")
print("ya cumpli los 20 años??",19>=20)

"""# Basic Math Operations

The basic math operators in python are demonstrated below:

**My own example 53**
"""

entero=35
flotante=3.1416
nuevotexto = str(entero)

"""**My own example 54**"""

import math 
print(3.1416/math.pi)
enterodepi=int(math.pi)
print(3/enterodepi)

"""# Data Collections

## List
A list is an ordered collection of values. A list is mutable, which means you can change a list's value without changing the list itself. Creating a list is simply putting different comma-separated values between square brackets.

**My own example 55**
"""

tareaslunes = ['lab',1, 'labs',2,'quiz']
print(tareaslunes)

"""The values in a list are called "elements". We can access list elements by indexing. Python index starts from 0. So if you have a list of length n, the index of the first element will be 0, and that of the last element will be n − 1. By the way, the length of a list can be obtained by the built-in function len()."""

print(animales[1:4])
animales.append('mono')
print(animales)
animales.remove('Pitón')
print(animales)

"""When there are repeated instances of "Hello", the first one is removed.

## Tuple
A tuple is a data structure type similar to a list. The difference is that a tuple is immutable, which means you can't change the elements in it once it's defined. We create a tuple by putting comma-separated values between parentheses.

**My own example 57**
"""

b="\#"
c="Ana"

"""

lista = ['apple','green','machine','green','archive','aple','F','green']
elementos = set(lista)
print(elementos)

"""Set is an easy way to remove duplicate elements from a list.

##Dictionary
A dictionary is one of the most important data structures in Python. Unlike sequences which are indexed by integers, dictionaries are indexed by keys which can be either strings or floats.

A dictionary is an **unordered** collection of key : value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique. We create a dictionary by placing a comma-separated list of key : value pairs within the braces.

# Logical Operations and Loops

# Introduction
We discussed the basic data types and data structures in Python in the last tutorial. This chapter covers logical operations and loops in Python, which are very common in programming.

# Logical Operations
Like most programming languages, Python has comparison operators:

"""

price = 9.99
price > 9 and price < 10

"""**My own example 80**"""

not (price > 5 and price < 10)

not price > 10

"""**My own example 82**"""

price = 9.99
price > 10 or price < 5

"""**My own example 83**"""

price = 9.99
price > 10 or price < 20

"""**My own example 84**"""

print(6 == 21)
print(2109 == 63)
print(14 != 86)
print(102010 >= 103)
print(4239 >= 4239)

"""**My own example 85**"""

print(False and b)
print(True and "OK" or "KO")
print( True and False or True)
print(True or True)  
print(True or False)  
print(False or True)  
print(False or False)

"""Each statement above has a boolean value, which must be either True or False, but not both.

We can combine simple statements P and Q to form complex statements using logical operators:

- The statement "P and Q" is true if both P and Q are true, otherwise it is false.
- The statement "P or Q" is false if both P and Q are false, otherwise it is true.
- The statement "not P" is true if P is false, and vice versa.

**My own example 86**
"""

print(1 > 1 and 0 > 0)
print(3 > 4 and 1 < 2) 
print(0 > -1 or 2 < 2)
print(-1 < 1 and 3 < -2)

"""When dealing with a very complex logical statement that involves in several statements, we can use brackets to separate and combine them.

**My own example 87**
"""

print(0 and not 1 or 1 and not 0 or 1 and 0)
x=3
print(x > 3 and x < 10)

"""Comparing the above two statements, we can see that it's wise to use brackets when we make a complex logical statement.

# If Statement
An if statement executes a segment of code only if its condition is true. A standard if statement consists of 3 segments: if, elif and else.

```python
if statement1:
    # if the statement1 is true, execute the code here.
    # code.....
    # code.....
elif statement2:
    # if the statement 1 is false, skip the codes above to this part.
    # code......
    # code......
else:
    # if none of the above statements is True, skip to this part
    # code......
```

An if statement doesn't necessarily has elif and else part. If it's not specified, the indented block of code will be executed when the condition is true, otherwise the whole if statement will be skipped.

y = 2
if y != 0:
    resultado = x / y
else:
    resultado = f'No se puede dividir {x} entre {y}'
print(resultado)

"""# Loop Structure

"""When making a while loop, we need to ensure that something changes from iteration to iteration so that the while loop will terminate, otherwise, it will run forever. Here we used i += 1 (short for i = i + 1) to make i larger after each iteration. This is the most commonly used method to control a while loop.

## For Loop
A "for" loop will iterate over a sequence of value and terminate when the sequence has ended.

# Object-Oriented Programming
Python is an object-oriented programming language. It's important to understand the concept of "objects" because almost every kind of data from QuantConnect API is an object.

## Class
A class is a type of data, just like a string, float, or list. When we create an object of that data type, we call it an instance of a class.

In Python, everything is an object - everything is an instance of some class. The data stored inside an object are called attributes, and the functions which are associated with the object are called methods.

For example, as mentioned above, a list is an object of the "list" class, and it has a method list.sort().

We can create our own objects by defining a class. We would do this when it's helpful to group certain functions together. For example, we define a class named "Stock" here:

**My own example 126**
"""

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

In this chapter we have introduced functions and classes. When we write a QuantConnect algorithm, we would define our algorithm as a class (QCAlgorithm). This means our algorithm inherited the QC API methods from QCAlgorithm class.

In the next chapter, we will introduce NumPy and Pandas, which enable us to conduct scientific calculations in Python.

NumPy is an incredibly powerful package in Python that is ubiquitous throughout the Quantopian platform. It has strong integration with Pandas, another tool we will be covering in the lecture series. NumPy adds support for multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions that allow you to easily perform linear algebra calculations. This lecture will be a collection of linear algebra examples computed using NumPy.

"""### Basic NumPy arrays

The most basic way that we could make use of NumPy in finance is calculating the mean return of a portfolio. Say that we have a list containing the historical return of several stocks.
"""

stock_list = [3.5, 5, 2, 8, 4.2]

"""We can make an array by calling a function on the list:"""

returns = np.array(stock_list)
print returns, type(returns)

"""You'll notice that the type of our array is 'ndarray', not just 'array'. This is because NumPy arrays can be created with multiple dimensions. If we pass np.array() a list of lists, it will create a 2-dimensional array. If we pass a list of lists of lists, it will create a 3-dimensional array, and so on and so forth."""

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

"""

"""### Calculating Expected Return

So we have a universe of stocks. Great! Now let's put them together in a portfolio and calculate its expected return and risk.

We will start off by generating $N$ random weights for each asset in our portfolio.
"""

weights = np.random.uniform(0, 1, N)
weights = weights/np.sum(weights)

"""We have to rescale the weights so that they all add up to $1$. We do this by scaling the weights vector by the sum total of all the weights. This step ensures that we will be using $100\%$ of the portfolio's cash.

To calculate the mean return of the portfolio, we have to scale each asset's return by its designated weight. We can pull each element of each array and multiply them individually, but it's quicker to use NumPy's linear algebra methods. The function that we want is `dot()`. This will calculate the dot product between two arrays for us. So if $v = \left[ 1, 2, 3 \right]$ and $w = \left[4, 5, 6 \right]$, then:

$$ v \cdot w = 1 \times 4 + 2 \times 5 + 3 \times 6 $$

For a one-dimensional vector, the dot product will multiply each element pointwise and add all the products together! In our case, we have a vector of weights, $\omega = \left[ \omega_1, \omega_2, \dots \omega_N\right]$ and a vector of returns, $\mu = \left[ \mu_1, \mu_2, \dots, \mu_N\right]$. If we take the dot product of these two we will get:

$$ \omega \cdot \mu = \omega_1\mu_1 + \omega_2\mu_2 + \dots + \omega_N\mu_N = \mu_P $$

This yields the sum of all the asset returns scaled by their respective weights. This the the portfolio's overall expected return!

print "Expected return of the portfolio: ", p_returns

"""Calculating the mean return is fairly intuitive and does not require too much explanation of linear algebra. However, calculating the variance of our portfolio requires a bit more background.

#### Beware of NaN values

Most of the time, all of these calculations will work without an issue. However, when working with real data we run the risk of having `nan` values in our arrays. This is NumPy's way of saying that the data there is missing or doesn't exist. These `nan` values can lead to errors in mathematical calculations so it is important to be aware of whether your array contains `nan` values and to know how to drop them.
"""

v = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])
print v

"""Let's see what happens when we try to take the mean of this array."""

print np.mean(v)

"""Clearly, `nan` values can have a large impact on our calculations. Fortunately, we can check for `nan` values with the `isnan()` function."""

np.isnan(v)

"""Calling `isnan()` on an array will call the function on each value of the array, returning a value of `True` if the element is `nan` and `False` if the element is valid. Now, knowing whether your array contains `nan` values is all well and good, but how do we remove `nan`s? Handily enough, NumPy arrays can be indexed by boolean values (`True` or `False`). If we use a boolean array to index an array, we will remove all values of the array that register as `False` under the condition. We use the `isnan()` function in create a boolean array, assigning a `True` value to everything that is *not* `nan` and a `False` to the `nan`s and we use that to index the same array."""

ix = ~np.isnan(v) # the ~ indicates a logical not, inverting the bools
print v[ix] # We can also just write v = v[~np.isnan(v)]

print np.mean(v[ix])

"""There are a few shortcuts to this process in the form of NumPy functions specifically built to handle them, such as `nanmean()`."""

print np.nanmean(v)

"""The `nanmean()` function simply calculates the mean of the array as if there were no `nan` values at all! There are a few more of these functions, so feel free to read more about them in the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html). These indeterminate values are more an issue with data than linear algebra itself so it is helpful that there are ways to handle them.

### Conclusion

Linear algebra is pervasive in finance and in general. For example, the calculation of *optimal* weights according to modern portfolio theory is done using linear algebra techniques. The arrays and functions in NumPy allow us to handle these calculations in an intuitive way. For a quick intro to linear algebra and how to use NumPy to do more significant matrix calculations, proceed to the next section.

## A brief foray into linear algebra

Let's start with a basic overview of some linear algebra. Linear algebra comes down to the multiplication and composition of scalar and matrix values. A scalar value is just a real number that we multiply against an array. When we scale a matrix or array using a scalar, we multiply each individual element of that matrix or array by the scalar.

A matrix is a collection of values, typically represented by an $m \times n$ grid, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. The edge lengths $m$ and $n$ do not necessarily have to be different. If we have $m = n$, we call this a square matrix. A particularly interesting case of a matrix is when $m = 1$ or $n = 1$. In this case we have a special case of a matrix that we call a vector. While there is a matrix object in NumPy we will be doing everything using NumPy arrays because they can have dimensions greater than $2$. For the purpose of this section, we will be using matrix and array interchangeably.

We can express the matrix equation as:

$$ y = A\cdot x $$

Where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $y$ is a $m \times 1$ vector, and $x$ is a $n \times 1$ vector. On the right-hand side of the equation we are multiplying a matrix by a vector. This requires a little bit more clarification, lest we think that we can go about multiplying any matrices by any other matrices.

#### Matrix multiplication

With matrix multiplication, the order in which the matrices are multiplied matters. Multiplying a matrix on the left side by another matrix may be just fine, but multiplying on the right may be undefined.
"""

A = np.array([
        [1, 2, 3, 12, 6],
        [4, 5, 6, 15, 20],
        [7, 8, 9, 10, 10]        
    ])
B = np.array([
        [4, 4, 2],
        [2, 3, 1],
        [6, 5, 8],
        [9, 9, 9]
    ])

"""Notice that the above-defined matrices, $A$ and $B$, have different dimensions. $A$ is $3 \times 5$ and $B$ is $4 \times 3$. The general rule of what can and cannot be multiplied in which order is based on the dimensions of the matrices. Specifically, the number of columns in the matrix on the left must be equal to the number of rows in the matrix on the right. In super informal terms, let's say that we have an $m \times n$ matrix and a $p \times q$ matrix. If we multiply the first by the second on the right, we get the following:

$$ (m \times n) \cdot (p \times q) = (m \times q) $$

So the resultant product has the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right matrix. This limitation of matrix multiplication with regards to dimensions is important to keep track of when writing code. To demonstrate this, we use the `dot()` function to multiply our matrices below:
"""

print np.dot(A, B)

"""These results make sense in accordance with our rule. Multiplying a $3 \times 5$ matrix on the right by a $4 \times 3$ matrix results in an error while multiplying a $4 \times 3$ matrix on the right by a $3 \times 5$ matrix results in a $4 \times 5$ matrix."""

print np.dot(B, A)

"""### Portfolio Variance

Let's return to our portfolio example from before. We calculated the expected return of the portfolio, but how do we calculate the variance? We start by trying to evaluate the portfolio as a sum of each individual asset, scaled by it's weight.

$$ VAR[P] = VAR[\omega_1 S_1 + \omega_2 S_2 + \cdots + \omega_N S_N] $$

Where $S_0, \cdots, S_N$ are the assets contained within our universe. If all of our assets were independent of each other, we could simply evaluate this as

$$ VAR[P] = VAR[\omega_1 S_1] + VAR[\omega_2 S_2] + \cdots + VAR[\omega_N S_N] = \omega_1^2\sigma_1^2 + \omega_2^2\sigma_2^2 + \cdots + \omega_N^2\sigma_N^2 $$

However, all of our assets depend on each other by their construction. They are all in some way related to our base asset and therefore each other. We thus have to calculate the variance of the portfolio by including the individual pairwise covariances of each asset. Our formula for the variance of the portfolio:

$$ VAR[P] = \sigma_P^2 = \sum_i \omega_i^2\sigma_i^2 + \sum_i\sum_{i\neq j} \omega_i\omega_j\sigma_i\sigma_j\rho_{i, j}, \ i, j \in \lbrace 1, 2, \cdots, N \rbrace $$

Where $\rho_{i,j}$ is the correlation between $S_i$ and $S_j$, $\rho_{i, j} = \frac{COV[S_i, S_j]}{\sigma_i\sigma_j}$. This seems exceedingly complicated, but we can easily handle all of this using NumPy arrays. First, we calculate the covariance matrix that relates all the individual stocks in our universe.
"""

cov_mat = np.cov(returns)
print cov_mat

"""This array is not formatted particularly nicely, but a covariance matrix is a very important concept. The covariance matrix is of the form:

$$ \left[\begin{matrix}
VAR[S_1] & COV[S_1, S_2] & \cdots & COV[S_1, S_N] \\
COV[S_2, S_1] & VAR[S_2] & \cdots & COV[S_2, S_N] \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
COV[S_N, S_1] & COV[S_N, S_2] & \cdots & VAR[S_N]
\end{matrix}\right] $$

So each diagonal entry is the variance of that asset at that index and each off-diagonal holds the covariance of two assets indexed by the column and row number. What is important is that once we have the covariance matrix we are able to do some very quick linear algebra to calculate the variance of the overall portfolio. We can represent the variance of the portfolio in array form as:

$$ \sigma_p^2 = \omega \ C \ \omega^\intercal$$

Where $C$ is the covariance matrix of all the assets and $\omega$ is the array containing the weights of each individual asset. The superscript $\intercal$ on the second $\omega$ listed above denotes the **transpose** of $\omega$. For a reference on the evaluation of the variance of a portfolio as a matrix equation, please see the Wikipedia article on [modern portfolio theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

The transpose of an array is what you get when you switch the rows and columns of an array. This has the effect of reflecting an array across what you might imagine as a diagonal. For example, take our array $A$ from before:
"""

print A

"""The transpose looks like a mirror image of the same array."""

print np.transpose(A)

"""But $\omega$ here is a 1-dimensional array, a vector! It makes perfect to take the transpose of $A$, a $3 \times 5$ array, as the output will be a $5 \times 3$ array, but a 1-dimensional array is not quite as intuitive. A typical 1-dimensional array can be thought of as a $1 \times n$ horizontal vector. Thus, taking the tranpose of this array essentially means changing it into a $n \times 1$ vertical vector. This makes sense because 1-dimensional arrays are still arrays and any multiplication done between 1-dimensional and higher dimensional arrays must keep in line with our dimensionality issue of matrix multiplication.

To make a long story short, we think of $\omega$ as $1 \times N$ since we have $N$ securities. This makes it so that $\omega^\intercal$ is $N \times 1$. Again, our covariance matrix is $N \times N$. So the overall multiplication works out like so, in informal terms:

$$ \text{Dimensions}(\sigma_p^2) = \text{Dimensions}(\omega C \omega^\intercal) = (1 \times N)\cdot (N \times N)\cdot (N \times 1) = (1 \times 1)$$

Multiplying the covariance matrix on the left by the plain horizontal vector and on the right by that vector's transpose results in the calculation of a single scalar ($1 \times 1$) value, our portfolio's variance.

So knowing this, let's proceed and calculate the portfolio variance! We can easily calculate the product of these arrays by using `dot()` for matrix multiplication, though this time we have to do it twice.
"""

# Calculating the portfolio volatility
var_p = np.dot(np.dot(weights, cov_mat), weights.T)
vol_p = np.sqrt(var_p)
print "Portfolio volatility: ", vol_p

"""To confirm this calculation, let's simply evaluate the volatility of the portfolio using only NumPy functions."""

# Confirming calculation
vol_p_alt = np.sqrt(np.var(np.dot(weights, returns), ddof=1))
print "Portfolio volatility: ", vol_p_alt

"""The `ddof` parameter is a simple integer input that tells the function the number of degrees of freedom to take into account. This is a more statistical concept, but what this tells us that our matrix calculation is correct!

A lot of this might not make sense at first glance. It helps to go back and forth between the theory and the code representations until you have a better grasp of the mathematics involved. It is definitely not necessary to be an expert on linear algebra and on matrix operations, but linear algebra can help to streamline the process of working with large amounts of data.

pandas is a Python library that provides a collection of powerful data structures to better help you manage data. In this lecture, we will cover how to use the `Series` and `DataFrame` objects to handle data. These objects have a strong integration with NumPy, covered elsewhere in the [lecture series](http://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Introduction-to-NumPy), allowing us to easily do the necessary statistical and mathematical calculations that we need for finance.

"""So let's have a look at how we actually build up to this point!

## pandas Data Structures

### `Series`

A pandas `Series` is a 1-dimensional array with labels that can contain any data type. We primarily use them for handling time series data. Creating a `Series` is as easy as calling `pandas.Series()` on a Python list or NumPy array.
"""

s = pd.Series([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])
print s

"""Every `Series` has a name. We can give the series a name as a parameter or we can define it afterwards by directly accessing the name attribute. In this case, we have given our time series no name so the attribute should be empty."""

print s.name

"""This name can be directly modified with no repercussions."""

s.name = "Toy Series"
print s.name

"""We call the collected axis labels of a `Series` its index. An index can either passed to a `Series` as a parameter or added later, similarly to its name. In the absence of an index, a `Series` will simply contain an index composed of integers, starting at $0$, as in the case of our "Toy Series"."""

print s.index

"""pandas has a built-in function specifically for creating date indices, `date_range()`. We use the function here to create a new index for `s`."""

new_index = pd.date_range("2016-01-01", periods=len(s), freq="D")
print new_index

"""An index must be exactly the same length as the `Series` itself. Each index must match one-to-one with each element of the `Series`. Once this is satisfied, we can directly modify the `Series` index, as with the name, to use our new and more informative index (relatively speaking)."""

s.index = new_index
print s.index

"""The index of the `Series` is crucial for handling time series, which we will get into a little later.

#### Accessing `Series` Elements

`Series` are typically accessed using the `iloc[]` and `loc[]` methods. We use `iloc[]` to access elements by integer index and we use `loc[]` to access the index of the Series.
"""

print "First element of the series: ", s.iloc[0]
print "Last element of the series: ", s.iloc[len(s)-1]

"""We can slice a `Series` similarly to our favorite collections, Python lists and NumPy arrays. We use the colon operator to indicate the slice."""

s.iloc[:2]

"""When creating a slice, we have the options of specifying a beginning, an end, and a step. The slice will begin at the start index, and take steps of size `step` until it passes the end index, not including the end."""

start = 0
end = len(s) - 1
step = 1

s.iloc[start:end:step]

"""We can even reverse a `Series` by specifying a negative step size. Similarly, we can index the start and end with a negative integer value."""

s.iloc[::-1]

"""This returns a slice of the series that starts from the second to last element and ends at the third to last element (because the fourth to last is not included, taking steps of size $1$)."""

s.iloc[-2:-4:-1]

"""We can also access a series by using the values of its index. Since we indexed `s` with a collection of dates (`Timestamp` objects) we can look at the value contained in `s` for a particular date."""

s.loc['2016-01-01']

"""Or even for a range of dates!"""

s.loc['2016-01-02':'2016-01-04']

"""With `Series`, we *can* just use the brackets (`[]`) to access elements, but this is not best practice. The brackets are ambiguous because they can be used to access `Series` (and `DataFrames`) using both index and integer values and the results will change based on context (especially with `DataFrames`).

#### Boolean Indexing

In addition to the above-mentioned access methods, you can filter `Series` using boolean arrays. `Series` are compatible with your standard comparators. Once compared with whatever condition you like, you get back yet another `Series`, this time filled with boolean values.
"""

print s < 3

"""We can pass *this* `Series` back into the original `Series` to filter out only the elements for which our condition is `True`."""

print s.loc[s < 3]

"""If we so desire, we can group multiple conditions together using the logical operators `&`, `|`, and `~` (and, or, and not, respectively)."""

print s.loc[(s < 3) & (s > 1)]

"""This is very convenient for getting only elements of a `Series` that fulfill specific criteria that we need. It gets even more convenient when we are handling `DataFrames`.

#### Indexing and Time Series

Since we use `Series` for handling time series, it's worth covering a little bit of how we handle the time component. For our purposes we use pandas `Timestamp` objects. Let's pull a full time series, complete with all the appropriate labels, by using our `get_pricing()` method. All data pulled with `get_pricing()` or using our Pipeline API will be in either `Series` or `DataFrame` format. We can modify this index however we like.
"""

start = "2012-01-01"
end = "2016-01-01"
prices = get_pricing(symbol, start_date=start, end_date=end, fields="price")

"""We can display the first few elements of our series by using the `head()` method and specifying the number of elements that we want. The analogous method for the last few elements is `tail()`."""

print "\n", type(prices)
prices.head(5)

"""As with our toy example, we can specify a name for our time series, if only to clarify the name the `get_pricing()` provides us."""

print 'Old name: ', prices.name
prices.name = symbol
print 'New name: ', prices.name

"""Let's take a closer look at the `DatetimeIndex` of our `prices` time series."""

print prices.index

"""Notice that this `DatetimeIndex` has a collection of associated information. In particular it has an associated frequency (`freq`) and an associated timezone (`tz`). The frequency indicates whether the data is daily vs monthly vs some other period while the timezone indicates what locale this index is relative to. We can modify all of this extra information!

If we resample our `Series`, we can adjust the frequency of our data. We currently have daily data (excluding weekends) because `get_pricing()` pulls only data from market days. Let's up-sample from this daily data to monthly data using the `resample()` method.
"""

monthly_prices = prices.resample('M')
monthly_prices.head(10)

"""The `resample()` method defaults to using the mean of the lower level data to create the higher level data. We can specify how else we might want the up-sampling to be calculated by specifying the `how` parameter."""

monthly_prices_med = prices.resample('M', how='median')
monthly_prices_med.head(10)

"""We can even specify how we want the calculation of the new period to be done. Here we create a `custom_resampler()` function that will return the first value of the period. In our specific case, this will return a `Series` where the monthly value is the first value of that month."""

def custom_resampler(array_like):
    """ Returns the first value of the period """
    return array_like[0]

first_of_month_prices = prices.resample('M', how=custom_resampler)
first_of_month_prices.head(10)

"""We can also adjust the timezone of a `Series` to adapt the time of real-world data. In our case, our time series is already localized to UTC, but let's say that we want to adjust the time to be 'US/Eastern'. In this case we use the `tz_convert()` method, since the time is already localized."""

eastern_prices = prices.tz_convert('US/Eastern')
eastern_prices.head(10)

"""In addition to the capacity for timezone and frequency management, each time series has a built-in `reindex()` method that we can use to realign the existing data according to a new set of index labels. If data does not exist for a particular label, the data will be filled with a placeholder value. This is typically `np.nan`, though we can provide a fill method.

The data that we `get_pricing()` only includes market days. But what if we want prices for every single calendar day? This will include holidays and weekends, times when you normally cannot trade equities.  First let's create a new `DatetimeIndex` that contains all that we want.
"""

calendar_dates = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq='D', tz='UTC')
print calendar_dates

"""Now let's use this new set of dates to reindex our time series. We tell the function that the fill method that we want is `ffill`. This denotes "forward fill". Any `NaN` values will be filled by the *last value* listed. So the price on the weekend or on a holiday will be listed as the price on the last market day that we know about."""

calendar_prices = prices.reindex(calendar_dates, method='ffill')
calendar_prices.head(15)

"""You'll notice that we still have a couple of `NaN` values right at the beginning of our time series. This is because the first of January in 2012 was a Sunday and the second was a market holiday! Because these are the earliest data points and we don't have any information from before them, they cannot be forward-filled. We will take care of these `NaN` values in the next section, when we deal with missing data.

#### Missing Data

Whenever we deal with real data, there is a very real possibility of encountering missing values. Real data is riddled with holes and pandas provides us with ways to handle them. Sometimes resampling or reindexing can create `NaN` values. Fortunately, pandas provides us with ways to handle them. We have two primary means of coping with missing data. The first of these is filling in the missing data with  `fillna()`. For example, say that we want to fill in the missing days with the mean price of all days.
"""

meanfilled_prices = calendar_prices.fillna(calendar_prices.mean())
meanfilled_prices.head(10)

"""Using `fillna()` is fairly easy. It is just a matter of indicating the value that you want to fill the spaces with. Unfortunately, this particular case doesn't make a whole lot of sense, for reasons discussed in the [lecture on stationarity](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/integration-cointegration-and-stationarity) in the Lecture series. We could fill them with with $0$, simply, but that's similarly uninformative.

Rather than filling in specific values, we can use the `method` parameter, similarly to how the `reindex()` method works. We could use "backward fill", where `NaN`s are filled with the *next* filled value (instead of forward fill's *last* filled value) like so:
"""

bfilled_prices = calendar_prices.fillna(method='bfill')
bfilled_prices.head(10)

"""But again, this is a bad idea for the same reasons as the previous option. Both of these so-called solutions take into account *future data* that was not available at the time of the data points that we are trying to fill. In the case of using the mean or the median, these summary statistics are calculated by taking into account the entire time series. Backward filling is equivalent to saying that the price of a particular security today, right now, tomorrow's price. This also makes no sense. These two options are both examples of look-ahead bias, using data that would be unknown or unavailable at the desired time, and should be avoided.

Our next option is significantly more appealing. We could simply drop the missing data using the `dropna()` method. This is much better alternative than filling `NaN` values in with arbitrary numbers.
"""

dropped_prices = calendar_prices.dropna()
dropped_prices.head(10)

"""Now our time series is cleaned for the calendar year, with all of our `NaN` values properly handled. It is time to talk about how to actually do time series analysis with pandas data structures.

#### Time Series Analysis with pandas

Let's do some basic time series analysis on our original prices. Each pandas `Series` has a built-in plotting method.
"""

prices.plot();
# We still need to add the axis labels and title ourselves
plt.title(symbol + " Prices")
plt.ylabel("Price")
plt.xlabel("Date");

"""As well as some built-in descriptive statistics. We can either calculate these individually or using the `describe()` method."""

print "Mean: ", prices.mean()
print "Standard deviation: ", prices.std()

print "Summary Statistics"
print prices.describe()

"""We can easily modify `Series` with scalars using our basic mathematical operators."""

modified_prices = prices * 2 - 10
modified_prices.head(5)

"""And we can create linear combinations of `Series` themselves using the basic mathematical operators. pandas will group up matching indices and perform the calculations elementwise to produce a new `Series`. """

noisy_prices = prices + 5 * pd.Series(np.random.normal(0, 5, len(prices)), index=prices.index) + 20
noisy_prices.head(5)

"""If there are no matching indices, however, we may get an empty `Series` in return."""

empty_series = prices + pd.Series(np.random.normal(0, 1, len(prices)))
empty_series.head(5)

"""Rather than looking at a time series itself, we may want to look at its first-order differences or percent change (in order to get additive or multiplicative returns, in our particular case). Both of these are built-in methods."""

add_returns = prices.diff()[1:]
mult_returns = prices.pct_change()[1:]

plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Percent Returns")

rolling_std.plot()
plt.title(rolling_std.name);
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Standard Deviation");

"""Many NumPy functions will work on `Series` the same way that they work on 1-dimensional NumPy arrays."""

print np.median(mult_returns)

"""The majority of these functions, however, are already implemented directly as `Series` and `DataFrame` methods."""

print mult_returns.median()

"""In every case, using the built-in pandas method will be better than using the NumPy function on a pandas data structure due to improvements in performance. Make sure to check out the `Series` [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html) before resorting to other calculations of common functions.

### `DataFrames`

Many of the aspects of working with `Series` carry over into `DataFrames`. pandas `DataFrames` allow us to easily manage our data with their intuitive structure. 

Like `Series`, `DataFrames` can hold multiple types of data, but `DataFrames` are 2-dimensional objects, unlike `Series`. Each `DataFrame` has an index and a columns attribute, which we will cover more in-depth when we start actually playing with an object. The index attribute is like the index of a `Series`, though indices in pandas have some extra features that we will unfortunately not be able to cover here. If you are interested in this, check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/advanced.html) on advanced indexing. The columns attribute is what provides the second dimension of our `DataFrames`, allowing us to combine named columns (all `Series`), into a cohesive object with the index lined-up.

We can create a `DataFrame` by calling `pandas.DataFrame()` on a dictionary or NumPy `ndarray`. We can also concatenate a group of pandas `Series` into a `DataFrame` using `pandas.concat()`.
"""

dict_data = {
    'a' : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'b' : ['L', 'K', 'J', 'M', 'Z'],
    'c' : np.random.normal(0, 1, 5)
}
print dict_data

"""Each `DataFrame` has a few key attributes that we need to keep in mind. The first of these is the index attribute. We can easily include an index of `Timestamp` objects like we did with `Series`."""

frame_data = pd.DataFrame(dict_data, index=pd.date_range('2016-01-01', periods=5))
print frame_data

"""As mentioned above, we can combine `Series` into `DataFrames`. Concatatenating `Series` like this will match elements up based on their corresponding index. As the following `Series` do not have an index assigned, they each default to an integer index. """

s_1 = pd.Series([2, 4, 6, 8, 10], name='Evens')
s_2 = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], name="Odds")
numbers = pd.concat([s_1, s_2], axis=1)
print numbers

"""We will use `pandas.concat()` again later to combine multiple `DataFrame`s into one.

Each `DataFrame` also has a `columns` attribute. These can either be assigned when we call `pandas.DataFrame` or they can be modified directly like the index. Note that when we concatenated the two `Series` above, the column names were the names of those `Series`.
"""

print numbers.columns

"""To modify the columns after object creation, we need only do the following:"""

print numbers

"""Separate from the columns and index of a `DataFrame`, we can also directly access the values they contain by looking at the values attribute."""

numbers.values

"""This returns a NumPy array."""

type(numbers.values)

"""#### Accessing `DataFrame` elements

Again we see a lot of carryover from `Series` in how we access the elements of `DataFrames`. The key sticking point here is that everything has to take into account multiple dimensions now. The main way that this happens is through the access of the columns of a `DataFrame`, either individually or in groups.

print type(prices.loc[:, 'CMG'])

When you pass a 2-dimensional tuple into a `DataFrame`, the first element of the tuple is applied to the rows and the second is applied to the columns. So, to break it down, the above line of code tells the `DataFrame` to return every single row of the column with label `'CMG'`. Lists of columns are also supported."""

"""#### Adding, Removing Columns, Combining `DataFrames`/`Series`

We add a new column simply by assigning data to a column that does not already exist. Here we use the `.loc[:, 'COL_NAME']` notation and store the output of `get_pricing()` (which returns a pandas `Series` if we only pass one security) there. This is the method that we would use to add a `Series` to an existing `DataFrame`.

# NumPy and Basic Pandas

# Introduction

Now that we have introduced the fundamentals of Python, it's time to learn about NumPy and Pandas.

# NumPy
NumPy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It also has strong integration with Pandas, which is another powerful tool for manipulating financial data.

Python packages like NumPy and Pandas contain classes and methods which we can use by importing the package:
"""

import numpy as np

"""## Basic NumPy Arrays
A NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. Here we make an array by passing a list of Apple stock prices:

**My own example 134**
"""

import numpy as np
arreglo_anidado = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
arreglo = np.array(arreglo_anidado)
print(arreglo, type(arreglo))

"""Notice that the type of array is "ndarray" which is a multi-dimensional array. If we pass np.array() a list of lists, it will create a 2-dimensional array.

**Mu own example 135**
"""

arreglo1 = np.zeros(5)
print(arreglo1, type(arreglo1))

"""We get the dimensions of an ndarray using the .shape attribute:"""

print(arreglo1.shape)

"""If we create an 2-dimensional array (i.e. matrix), each row can be accessed by index:"""

print(arreglo1[0])
print(arreglo1[1])

"""**My own exapmle 136**"""

a = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0], dtype=bool)
b = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0], dtype=bool)
print(a, type(a))
print(b, type(b))
print(a[2],b[3])
print(a.shape, b.shape)

"""**My own example 137**"""

print(np.zeros((4,5)))
c = np.zeros((4,5))
print('la primera columna es: ',c[:,0])
print('la primera fila es:',c[1,:])

"""**My own example 138**"""

import numpy as np

matriz = [
	[21, 22, 23],
	[34, 35, 36],
	[47, 48, 49]
]
matriz_np = np.array(matriz)

i = 1 #columna que queremos eliminar
matriz_nueva_np = np.delete(matriz_np, i, axis=1)
print(matriz_nueva_np)

"""**My own example 139**"""

print(np.linspace(0,10,20))

"""## Array Functions
Some functions built in NumPy that allow us to perform calculations on arrays. For example, we can apply the natural logarithm to each element of an array:

print(np.log(price_array))

"""Other functions return a single value:

**My own example 141**
"""

print(np.mean(price_array))
print(np.std(price_array))
print(np.sum(price_array))
print(np.max(price_array))

"""**My own example 142**"""

a = np.arange(36)
b = a.reshape((6,6))
print(b, type(b))

If we intended to take the second element of the series, we would make a mistake here, because the index are integers. In order to access to the element we want, we use iloc[] here:

While working with time series data, we often use time as the index. Pandas provides us with various methods to access the data by time index

Series[] provides us a very flexible way to index data. We can add any condition in the square brackets:

Representing data graphically can be incredibly useful for learning how the data behaves and seeing potential structure or flaws. Care should be taken, as humans are incredibly good at seeing only evidence that confirms our beliefs, and visual data lends itself well to that. Plots are good to use when formulating a hypothesis, but should not be used to test a hypothesis.

We will go over some common plots here.

"""## Getting Some Data

If we're going to plot data we need some data to plot. We'll get the pricing data of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) to use in our examples.

### Data Structure

Knowing the structure of your data is very important. Normally you'll have to do a ton of work molding your data into the form you need for testing. Quantopian has done a lot of cleaning on the data, but you still need to put it into the right shapes and formats for your purposes.

In this case the data will be returned as a pandas dataframe object. The rows are timestamps, and the columns are the two assets, AAPL and MSFT.

**My own example 199**

"""##Histogram

A histogram is a visualization of how frequent different values of data are. By displaying a frequency distribution using bars, it lets us quickly see where most of the observations are clustered. The height of each bar represents the number of observations that lie in each interval. You can think of a histogram as an empirical and discrete Probability Density Function (PDF).

In finance rarely will we look at the distribution of prices. The reason for this is that prices are non-stationary and move around a lot. For more info on non-stationarity please see [this lecture](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/integration-cointegration-and-stationarity). Instead we will use daily returns. Let's try that now.

A line graph can be used when we want to track the development of the y value as the x value changes. For instance, when we are plotting the price of a stock, showing it as a line graph instead of just plotting the data points makes it easier to follow the price over time. This necessarily involves "connecting the dots" between the data points, which can mask out changes that happened between the time we took measurements.

Again, whenever using plots to visualize data, do not assume you can test a hypothesis by looking at a graph. Also do not assume that because a distribution or trend used to be true, it is still true. In general much more sophisticated and careful validation is required to test whether models hold. Plots are mainly useful when initially deciding how your models should work.
